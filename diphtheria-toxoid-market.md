<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diphtheria Toxoid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reducing Toxin</li><li>Denatured Toxin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Diphtheria Toxoid market comprises two main types: reducing toxins and denatured toxins. Reducing toxins involve the modification of the active diphtheria toxin to diminish its virulence while preserving its immunogenic properties, allowing the body to build immunity. Denatured toxins, on the other hand, refer to toxins that have undergone chemical or physical changes to render them inactive, yet still stimulate an immune response. Both types are essential for effective vaccination against diphtheria.</p></p>
