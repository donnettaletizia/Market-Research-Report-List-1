<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Needle-free Infusion Connectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure</li><li>Non Positive Pressure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The needle-free infusion connectors market comprises two primary types: positive pressure and non-positive pressure connectors. Positive pressure connectors maintain a constant pressure in the infusion line, minimizing blood reflux and reducing the risk of clot formation. They are often used in higher-risk settings. Non-positive pressure connectors, on the other hand, allow for passive pressure release, facilitating fluid flow without maintaining extra pressure. This type is commonly preferred for less complex infusions, enhancing patient comfort and safety.</p></p>
