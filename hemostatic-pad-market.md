<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hemostatic Pad Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gelatin Hemostatic Pad</li><li>Fibrin Hemostatic Pad</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hemostatic pad market includes two main types: gelatin and fibrin hemostatic pads. Gelatin hemostatic pads are derived from porcine or bovine sources, promoting rapid clot formation by providing a scaffold for platelet aggregation. They are ideal for controlling bleeding in surgical and traumatic situations. Fibrin hemostatic pads, on the other hand, are made from fibrinogen and thrombin, facilitating clot development through a biological mechanism that mimics the natural coagulation process. Both types enhance hemostasis effectively in various clinical settings.</p></p>
