<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Garment Interlining Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fusible interlining</li><li>Non Fuse Interlining</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The garment interlining market primarily consists of two types: fusible interlining and non-fusible interlining. Fusible interlining features a heat-activated adhesive on one side, allowing it to bond directly to the fabric when pressed. This provides stability and shape while maintaining flexibility. Non-fusible interlining, on the other hand, lacks adhesive and relies on sewing or other methods for attachment. It is often used in delicate fabrics where heat application is not feasible, offering support without altering the fabric's characteristics.</p></p>
